****Building a Class: Methods****
-->Since methods are usually actions, name
	them using verbs (Save, Retrieve, etc.)

****Testing the methods****

****Terms****
-->Signature
	Class/methodName(parameters)
-->Overloading: same class/method name but different parameters
-->Contract
	--> right-click, outlining, collapse to definitons
	--> to bring it back, hit "toggle all outlining"

****Building a class: constructors****
-->ctor: snippit command that will generate the constructor
-->The code within the constructor are used to initailize the object
-->A constructor with no parameters is called a "Default Constructor"
	-->If there's no need for code in a constructor, simply don't create one
		An implicit constructor is created automatically.
		-->An exemption being if there is an overloaded constructor. In 
			this case, an empty contructor is acceptable
