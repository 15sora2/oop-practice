****Seperation of Concerns****
-->Minimizes coupling
	-->The degree that a class is dependent on other classes
	-->Fewer dependencies = easier to manage/write/modify
-->Maximizing Cohesion
	-->If a class has too many dependencies, consider moving some to 
		another class
-->Coupling and Cohesion
	-->Low Coupling:
	-->High Cohesion: helps produced a well-defined and focused class
-->Simplifies maintenance
-->Improves testability

****Revisiting the Class Diagram
-->Separating responsibilities
-->  Repository Class is a class dedicated to retrieving 
	and saving data
